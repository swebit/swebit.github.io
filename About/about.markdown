<p>My name is Patrik and I am a 30 year old boomer from Sweden that studies computer science at Linnéuniversitetet. I hail from the province called
Bohuslän and I grew up in a village called Kungshamn. Its a village that sits next to the sea on the west coast of Sweden and has a population of 
approximately 3000 people.</p>
