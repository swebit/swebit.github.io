<h1>Why do we use static site generetors?</h1>

<p>A static site generator is a program that uses or takes source files and converts it into a static web site, in this case we are using Jekyll.</p>

<p>There are different static site generators out on the web and from my understanding some of them are specified to serve a specific purposes. For instance
   there are programs which takes the directory of images or photos and converts it into a web site with a photo gallery. There are other static site
   generators that help you build documentation web sites, there are also some that helps you create digital books and much more.</p>

<p> Static site generators helps us to create the foundation of a web site. As many of them (if not all?) comes with pre written code. That makes it so that we can
    use the foundation that the SSG already created and change or add things to our created web site. It should be usable in a lot of different projects as it saves time
    that can be used elsewhere.</p>
