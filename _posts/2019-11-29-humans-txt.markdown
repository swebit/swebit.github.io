<h3>Humans.txt</h3>

<p>The humans.txt file is like the end credits of a movie. Here you can put the names of those who created the
   web site and other information like what programs that was used in order to create the web site.</p>

<p>I choose to write about myself and the software that was used. I also gave a small thanks :)!
