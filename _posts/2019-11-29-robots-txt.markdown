<h3>Robots.txt</h3>
<p>The robots.txt file is a file that "lives" on your website as you can view
   the file by simply searching for it on the website i.e. *webbsitename*/robots.txt.
</p>
<p>It is recommended that you have a robots.txt file at your website as it makes it so
   that web crawlers can visit your site. If you have a robots.txt then the user, who searches information,
   can get your web page as an alternative when the search is done.
</p>
<p>I have made it so that the crawlers can use all information except the image files.
   So when the user searches for my website, they will not find my web page by searching images.
